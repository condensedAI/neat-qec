# A NEAT Quantum Error Decoder

This repository hosts all of the code that was used in this publication: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08093](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08093)
If you would like to use the same reinforcement learning environment, an adaptation of the toric code game can be found as part of [SciGym](http://www.scigym.net/).

## Description
The code requires the installation of the python package https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
